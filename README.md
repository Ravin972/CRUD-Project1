# "Social Media Web App - Basic CRUD Operations for User Posts and Comments"

This is a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on social media posts. The app is built using html, css & javascript.

Users can create new posts with a title and content, view a list of all posts, update the title and/or content of existing posts, and delete posts they no longer want. The app also includes basic user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.

This web app is a great starting point for developers who are new to web development and want to learn how to build CRUD operations into their web applications. It can be easily customized and extended with additional features, such as commenting or liking posts, to create a more robust social media platform.
